Day 5:
    - Partition the ranges by maps src ranges
    - Apply the map on partitioned ranges

Day 6:
    time: t, distance: d, record distance: r
    hold for n seconds to charge: travel at speed n for (t-n) time

    (t-n) * n > r
    tn - n^2 > r
    n^2-tn+r < 0

    n = (t (+/-) sqrt(t^2 - 4*r)) / 2

    if: (t^2 - 4r < 0) No solution
    else: (t - sqrt(t^2 - 4r))/2 < n < (t + sqrt(t^2 - 4r))/2


    Time: 30, Distance: 200
    winning range: 10 to 20

Day 7:
    List of hands, order them based on the strength of each hand
    A hand has 5 cards: K, Q, J, T, A, 9-2 (in order of decreasing strength) 

    Every hand is exactly one of these types:
    - Five of a kind: AAAAA
    - Four of a kind: AA8AA
    - Full house: AABBB
    - Three of a kind: AAABC
    - Two pair: AABBC
    - One pair: AABCD
    - High Card: ABCDE
    (listed in the order of decreasing strength)

    For two hands of same type, hand with higher value card in ith position, with previous (i-1) cards of same value is better

    Input: hand bid
        win = bid * rank of hand (amongst the listed hands)
        calculate sum of all winning amounts

    Card    Score
    2-9     2-9
    T       10
    J       11
    Q       12
    K       13
    A       14


Day 10: Pipe Maze
------------------

Pipes: 

    (  
        N       N = (-1, 0)
       W E      W = (0, -1), E = (0, 1)
        S       S = (1, 0)
    )

    | = vertical Pipe connecting North and South, 
    - = horizontal pipe connecting east and west
    L - 90-degree bend connecting north and east
    J - 90-degree bend connecting north and west
    7 - 90-degree bend connecting south and west
    F - 90-degree bend connecting south and east
    . - ground, no pipe
    S - starting position

    pipes may not be connected to the loop
    every pipe in the main loop connects to its two neighbours

    Find the tile in the loop which is the farthest away from the starting point in the loop
